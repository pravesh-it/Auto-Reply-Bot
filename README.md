# Auto-Reply-Bot

## üëã Welcome to My GitHub Profile
Hello! This repository contains automation scripts for WhatsApp chat interaction, position automation with PyAutoGUI, and OpenAI chatbot integration, all built with Python.

## üìÇ Project Overview
1. program.py
Automates WhatsApp Web chat interactions by:

Clicking UI elements using PyAutoGUI

Copying chat history from the screen

Analyzing chat history to determine who sent the last message

Sending a suggested reply generated by OpenAI's GPT model

2. main.py
Debug utility to print screen coordinates using PyAutoGUI.
Use this script to get precise positions for clicks and region selection.

3. client.py
Provides a minimal example to directly interact with the OpenAI API.

You can test your system prompts and get "Pravesh-style" responses.

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/pravesh-it/Auto-Reply-Bot
cd Auto-Reply-Bot
2. Install Dependencies
A requirements.txt file is included for easy package installation:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure OpenAI Credentials
Edit program.py and client.py to add your OpenAI API key where indicated.

4. Run the Scripts
For automation:

bash
python program.py
For coordinate debugging:

bash
python main.py
For OpenAI chat test:

bash
python client.py
Make sure WhatsApp Web is open and visible for the automation script to function correctly.
Some hotkey and coordinate features may require you to adjust screen offsets for your own setup.

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
## For best stability, use virtual environments (python -m venv venv).
